# Marketing-Page for dad-jokes-puns.netlify.com


Dad Jokes is a site full of bad jokes and puns guarantee to annoy your kids and anyone within hearing distance! This marketing site is to boost traffic to dad-jokes-puns.netlify.com. If you want to add more pages or modify what we've already done, just follow these steps.

## Part 1:

- [ ] Fork this repository!
- [ ] Clone your own version of the repo (not ours! or something bad will happen)
- [ ] Make your own branch! Go absolutely wild with Punny Power: git checkout -b <branchnamehere>
- [ ] Do any and all changes on that new branch <branchnamehere>, make sure to commit often
- [ ] Push commits with: git push origin <branchnamehere>
  
  
  ## Part 2:  
  
- [ ] Make sure you've got LESS installed by checking lessc -v in your terminal (it should reply with a version message)
- [ ] In the terminal, navigate to the Marketing-Page directory using cd as many times as you need
- [ ] Add a few files if you want new content! touch newpage.html and touch index.less
- [ ] When you have all the files you want, run this command: less-watch-compiler less css newpage.less
- [ ] Make sure the compiler is actually working by changing the background color to something neat.
- [ ] When that works, you can delete it and go to the next part!


## Part 3:

- [ ] Go to the index.less files and import and create these files in this order!
- [ ] variables.less
- [ ] mixins.less
- [ ] reset.less
- [ ] global.less
- [ ] navigation.less
- [ ] footer.less
- [ ] home-page.less

## Part 4:

From here, you're good to make whatever edits and content you want! Maybe embed some hidden dad jokes only seen in the console for the page. Go Dad Wild!
